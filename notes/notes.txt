I created this Java codes because I want to implement the concept of Object Oriented Programming in Java.
In this case, I use a password manager as a topic because this is my Android application that I am currently working on.

Example: no., Name, email, etc... 
Primary key: no. (Number)
Relation table: 

---User Master Password: user_master_pswd.java---
Description: Whenever user wants to access their password at the password vault, they have to enter a special key called master password.
Example: master_key_no, pswd, salt, hash_pswd. (Make sure it's highly encrypted)
Primary key: master_key_no
Relation table: 

---User Password Vault: pswd_vault.java---

***REMINDER!***
1. Do not get confused with wp_user and user_acc. wp_user is a user who registers to the password manager. user_acc, on the other hand, stores the user accounts (social media, banking, etc...) in password manager vault.
